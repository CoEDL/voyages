### Introduction to Language Data

Aspects of data preparation for machine learning and language tech development and use. Data fundamentals such as international standards (ISO codes and Unicodes) are included.

### Natural Language Processing

An introduction to processing language texts, including Natural Language Understanding techniques such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, linguistic metadata prediction. Natural Language Generation techniques such as summarisation and question-answering are introduced. 

### Automatic Speech Recognition

The requirements for developing and using speech recognition technology, with a focus on Kaldi, ESPnet and wav2vec2 used in the Elpis ASR system. This module also includes considerations for developing user-friendly language technologies.

### Text-to-Speech

An overview of the major techniques used in developing and using text to speech systems, with background information relating to sound formats and compression.

### Indigenous AI

What is AI, and why does it need Indigenous knowledge? This module explores the value and impact of different perspectives on AI and ML technology development, with examples of object recognition in a language context.

### Sign and Gesture Language Technologies 

This module covers the latest developments in sign and gesture recognition and production. Further considerations for ethically co-designing appropriate technologies are also covered.

### Language Models and Language Generation

Language models are the probabilities of a particular sequence of words occuring in a sentence. Language models underpin many language technologies. This module introduces the concept and techniques of building language models, and the application of these in the generation of language.

### Neural Machine Translation

This module describes approaches to machine translation, requirements for data preparation to build and use machine translation systems, and detail of machine translation techniques.

### Conversational AI

In this module, the history of chat tech is described along with ethical implications of conversational language tech.
