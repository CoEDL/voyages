Follow the slides and watch the recording to use Amazon Lex to build chatbots.

You will need to make unique intent names for your bots. Include your surname, e.g. `foleyFindLibraryThings`.

If you get a `checkSum` error when building the bot, this is most likely due to names of slots and placeholders in the response not matching.
