# Voyages 3 Natural Language Processing

This module gives an introduction to techniques for computationally processing and understanding natural languages. These techniques are required to prepare human language data into a format that can be readily used by computers.

The techniques we will cover in the practical session are used in preparation of human language into forms that computers can work with more easily. 

## Linguistic features

[This Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1w0CHRS4-h4UoS7k5ErzaRrKnXRmbQbgY?usp=sharing) demonstrates methods of parsing nautral language to get information about linguistic features such as parts of speech (POS) and named entity recognition (NER). We can derive structure in the language using dependency parsing.

## Word embeddings

In [this Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1EcjqI9lbiSw5gtZr9Ss9Nns1uINuasRU?usp=sharing) we find the relationships between words and sentences.

Try the [projector visualisation](http://projector.tensorflow.org/) tool.

## Sentiment analysis 

Sentiment analysis is used to determine the emotion in language. [This Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/17H8bLQSWNdKEikGda2mZaaDHxaMJyHUI?usp=sharing) demonstrates an approach to analysing sentiment using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK).

## Sarcasm detection

That last practical activity was great. Sarcastic or not? Try [this Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1YxytGb1_qGtEM-fGLmkyomp19Co-6pr8?usp=sharing) to train a sarcasm detection model.
