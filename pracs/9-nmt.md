# Voyages 9 Neural Machine Translation

In this tutorial, you'll be training and testing a neural machine translation system using Tensorflow 2 and Keras. The task your network will perform is Kabyle to English translation. Kabyle is a Berber language, thought to have up to 8 million speakers (mostly residing in Algeria); however, it is not yet available on Google translate.

Your translation system will be based on the transformer architecture, first defined [here](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7181-attention-is-all-you-need.pdf). A lot of the code is already done for you, but you'll need to fill in each of the TODOs as instructed in the comments in order to get the code to work.
